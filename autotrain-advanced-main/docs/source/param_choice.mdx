# Parameter Choice

Just like model choice, you can choose the parameters for your job in two ways: AutoTrain and Manual.

## AutoTrain Mode

In the AutoTrain mode, the parameters for your task-model pair will be chosen automagically.
If you choose "AutoTrain" as model choice, you get the AutoTrain mode as the only option.
If you choose "HuggingFace Hub" as model choice, you get the the option to choose between AutoTrain and Manual mode for parameter choice.

An example of AutoTrain mode for a text classification task is shown below:

For most of the tasks in AutoTrain parameter selection mode, you will get "Number of Models" as the only parameter to choose. Some tasks like test-classification might ask you about the language of the dataset.
The more the number of models, the better the final results might be but it might be more expensive too!

## Manual Mode

Manual model can be used only when you choose "HuggingFace Hub" as model choice. In this mode, you can choose the parameters for your task-model pair manually.
An example of Manual mode for a text classification task is shown below:

In the manual mode, you have to add the jobs on your own. So, carefully select your parameters, click on "Add Job" and ðŸ’¥.
