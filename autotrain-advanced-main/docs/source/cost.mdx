# How much does it cost?

AutoTrain provides you with best models which are deployable with just a few clicks.
Unlike other services, we don't own your models. Once the training is done, you can download them and use them anywhere you want.

Before you start training, you can see the estimated cost of training.

Free tier is available for everyone. For a limited number of samples, you can train your models for free!
If your dataset is larger, you will be presented with the estimated cost of training.
Training will begin only after you confirm the payment.

Please note that in order to use non-free tier AutoTrain, you need to have a valid payment method on file.
You can add your payment method in the [billing](https://huggingface.co/settings/billing) section.

Estimated cost will be displayed in the UI as follows:
